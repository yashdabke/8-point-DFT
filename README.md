# 8 point DFT

The designed circuit of 8-point DFT based on product of Rademacher functions has been done successfully.

Initially, the circuit consists of smaller DFT blocks which are two 4-point DFTs and four 2-point DFTs. The analysis of type number used, internal connections and complex conjugate has been accomplished.

Based on these, the efficient 8-point DFT has been achieved. The efficient circuit involved two modified 4-point DFTs and three 2-point DFTs. Moreover, the design of the modified 4-point DFT and the simple 2-point DFT also has been constructed.

Several output results of the designed DFT have been removed since they are equal in terms of magnitude, two negative circuit are required as a compensation.
